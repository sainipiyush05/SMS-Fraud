# SMS-Fraud

SMS Fraud Detection

1.	Project Overview: This project aims to identify fraudulent SMS messages using machine learning techniques, reducing the risk of financial loss and improving user security.

2.	Dataset: The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing both legitimate and fraudulent SMS messages, allowing it to learn patterns indicative of fraud.

3.	Preprocessing: Text preprocessing steps include tokenization, removal of stop words, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare the data for analysis.

4.	Feature Extraction: Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are used to convert SMS text into numerical features for model training.

5.	Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) are implemented to compare their effectiveness in detecting fraudulent messages.

6.	Performance Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliability in detection.

7.	Deployment: The fraud detection system can be integrated into existing SMS services or applications to provide real-time alerts for potentially fraudulent messages.

8.	Usage Instructions: Step-by-step guidance on how to run the detection model and interpret results, along with any necessary dependencies or installation instructions.

9.	Future Work: Suggestions for improving the model, such as exploring deep learning techniques or incorporating more diverse datasets.
